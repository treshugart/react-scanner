# react-scanner

Crawls a site and generates screenshots showing the usage of our Atlaskit components.

_Currently this is in super-duper alpha and is only intended for Atlassian purposes, but it's under active development to make it more generic._

## Install

This is not currently installable as command as it's not in an abstract enough state for anyone to use. To use it, clone the repo.

## Usage

Once cloned, run `src/index.js`. Screenshots will be generated in `./screenshots`.
